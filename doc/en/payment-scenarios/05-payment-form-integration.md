## <a name="form"></a> "sale-form", "preauth-form", "transfer-form" requests

* **sale-form** - used to make a payment with a credit card
* **preauth-form** - used to block an amount on a credit card. Later it is necessary to call **[capture](01-preauth-capture-transactions.md#capture)** to actually charge the amount
* **transfer-form** - used to transfer money from one card to another

Card data is entered on PaynetEasy gateway side.

## <a name="form-redirect"></a> Payment processing after the client has returned from the payment form

When the user is redirected from the payment form, payment processing result data will be sent to merchant service with the user. Processing of that data is described in the [basic library usage example](../00-basic-tutorial.md#stage_2).

## <a name="callback"></a> Обработка обратного вызова

## <a name="callback"></a> Callback processing

After payment processing has been finished by PaynetEasy, data with processing result is sent to merchant service using a callback. This is done to allow payment to be processed by merchant service regardless of whether user was correctly redirected from PaynetEasy gateway or not. Processing of that data is the same as processing of data for [sale-form, preauth-form or transfer-form](05-payment-form-integration.md) and it is described in the [basic library usage example](../00-basic-tutorial.md#stage_2).
