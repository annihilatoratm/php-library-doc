## <a name="create-card-ref"></a> "create-card-ref" request

This request is used to create an ID which may be used to reference a card stored at PaynetEasy. This ID allows to make recurrent payments without a necessity to enter card data again.
For this request to be used, it is necessary to perform one of the following scenarios to create verification transaction:
* [Sale Transactions](00-sale-transactions.md)
* [Preauth/Capture Transactions](01-preauth-capture-transactions.md)
* [Payment Form Integration](05-payment-form-integration.md)

[create-card-ref request execution example](../../../example/create-card-ref.php)

This request creates an ID of a saved credit card embedded in **[RecurrentCard](../library-internals/00-payment-data.md#RecurrentCard)** object. To access **RecurrentCard**, call `$paymentTransaction->getPayment()->getRecurrentCardFrom()`; to access card reference ID, call `$paymentTransaction->getPayment()->getRecurrentCardFrom()->getCardReferenceId()`

## <a name="transfer-by-ref"></a> "transfer-by-ref" request

Used to transfer an amount from one card to another one.
Before using this request, it is necessary to create at least one card reference using [create-card-ref](#create-card-ref). Two [create-card-ref](#create-card-ref), may be executed to use them both for transfer (one for source card, another for destination card).
After executing this request, "**status**" request needs to be polled to update payment status. To achieve this, merchant service may display a self-updating page, each reload of which will make "**status**" request.

[transfer-by-ref request execution example](../../../example/transfer-by-ref.php)

## <a name="status"></a> "status" request

This request is used to check payment status. Usually, a series of such requests is required, because payment processingn takes some time. Depending on client authorization type (is 3D Authorization required or not) and payment status, processing of this request may be performed in different ways.

##### Payment update is required

If payment status did not change (**status** field has **processing** value) and there is not need of additional authorization steps, status needs to be called again after some time.

##### 3D Authorization is required

Response will contain **html** field, which content needs to be output to client's browser. Field content is a form which redirects a user to perform 3D Authorization.

##### Payment processing finished

Response's **status** field contains final payment status: **approved**, **filtered**, **declined**, **error**, **unknown**

##### Mandatory request parameters

Request parameter   |Payment property chain |Validation chain
--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------
client_orderid      |payment.clientId       |Validator::ID
orderid             |payment.paynetId       |Validator::ID
login               |queryConfig.login      |Validator::MEDIUM_STRING

[status request execution example](../../../example/status.php)

## <a name="callback"></a> Callback processing

After payment processing has been finished by PaynetEasy, data with processing result is sent to merchant service using a callback. This is done to allow payment to be processed by merchant service regardless of whether user was correctly redirected from PaynetEasy gateway or not.
