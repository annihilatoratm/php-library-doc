## <a name="sale"></a> "sale" request

This request is used to make a payment with a credit card. Card data is entered at merchant service side and sent to PaynetEasy. After executing this request, "**status**" request needs to be polled to update payment status. To achieve this, merchant service may display a self-updating page, each reload of which will make "**status**" request.

[sale request execution example](../../../example/sale.php)

## <a name="status"></a> "status" request

This request is used to check payment status. Usually, a series of such requests is required, because payment processingn takes some time. Depending on client authorization type (is 3D Authorization required or not) and payment status, processing of this request may be performed in different ways.

##### Payment update is required

If payment status did not change (**status** field has **processing** value) and there is not need of additional authorization steps, status needs to be called again after some time.

##### 3D Authorization is required

Response will contain **html** field, which content needs to be output to client's browser. Field content is a form which redirects a user to perform 3D Authorization.

##### Payment processing finished

Response's **status** field contains final payment status: **approved**, **filtered**, **declined**, **error**, **unknown**

##### Mandatory request parameters

Request parameter   |Payment property chain |Validation chain
--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------
client_orderid      |payment.clientId       |Validator::ID
orderid             |payment.paynetId       |Validator::ID
login               |queryConfig.login      |Validator::MEDIUM_STRING

[status request execution example](../../../example/status.php)

## <a name="3d-redirect"></a> Processing payment result after 3D Authorization

If a 3D Authorization was performed during payment processing, then when a user is redirected back from authorization form, payment processing result data will be sent to merchant service. Processing of this data is the same as processing for [sale-form, preauth-form and transfer-form](05-payment-form-integration.md) flows, it is described in the [basic library usage example](../00-basic-tutorial.md#stage_2).

## <a name="callback"></a> Callback processing

After payment processing has been finished by PaynetEasy, data with processing result is sent to merchant service using a callback. This is done to allow payment to be processed by merchant service regardless of whether user was correctly redirected from PaynetEasy gateway or not.
